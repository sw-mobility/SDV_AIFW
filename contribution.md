## **Code of Conduct**

Please review our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before contributing. We aim to create a community where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued.

## **How Can I Contribute?**

### **1. Reporting Bugs**
If you encounter a bug, please let us know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/your-repo-name/issues). When reporting a bug, please include:
- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **Steps to reproduce the issue**
- **Expected and actual results**
- **Screenshots or logs** (if applicable)
- **Environment details** (OS, browser, dependencies, etc.)

This information helps us diagnose and resolve the issue more quickly.

---

### **2. Suggesting Enhancements**
We’re always looking for ways to improve! If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, please [open a feature request](https://github.com/your-repo-name/issues) and provide:
- **A clear and descriptive title**
- **Problem you’re trying to solve**
- **Proposed solution** (if applicable)
- **Any alternative solutions you’ve considered**

We’ll review and discuss your proposal to see how it fits into the project’s goals.

---

### **3. Submitting Code Changes**
If you’d like to contribute code, please follow these steps:
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork** locally (`git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`)
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`)
4. **Make your changes** following our [Style Guides](#style-guides)
5. **Run tests** to ensure everything works (`npm test`, `pytest`, etc.)
6. **Commit your changes** (`git commit -m "Add new feature"`)
7. **Push your branch** to your fork (`git push origin feature/your-feature-name`)
8. **Create a pull request** from your branch to `main` or `dev` (as specified by the project maintainers)

Be sure to reference any related issues (e.g., `Closes #1234`) in your pull request description.

---

## **Development Workflow**

Here’s a quick overview of our workflow:
1. **Work on a feature branch**. Never work directly on `main`.
2. **Submit pull requests** to merge changes into `main` or `dev`.
3. **Wait for review and feedback**. Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers and other contributors.
4. **Address requested changes**. If changes are requested, update your pull request.
5. **Get approval and merge**. Once approved, your changes will be merged!

---

## **Style Guides**
To maintain code consistency, we follow these guidelines:
- **Code Style**: Follow the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) or [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) rules for formatting.
- **Commit Messages**: Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.
- **File and Folder Structure**: Keep files logically organized. Follow existing patterns.

Run `npm run lint` (or the equivalent command) before submitting code to ensure it’s properly formatted.

## **Need Help?**

We’re here to help you succeed! If you’re unsure about something or need guidance, feel free to:
- **Ask a question in Discussions** (if enabled)
- **Open an issue** with a "Question" label
- **Join our community chat** (if applicable, link to Slack/Discord)
